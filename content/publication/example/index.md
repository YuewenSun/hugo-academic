abstract: "Our goal is to find time-delayed latent causal variables and identify
  their relations from temporal measured variables. Estimating latent causal
  variable graphs from observations is particularly challenging as the latent
  variables are not uniquely recoverable in the most general case. In this work,
  we consider both a nonparametric, nonstationary setting and a parametetric
  setting for the latent processes and propose two provable conditions under
  which temporally causal latent processes can be identified. We propose LEAP, a
  theoretically-grounded architecture that extends Variational Autoencoders
  (VAEs) by enforcing our conditions through proper constraints in causal
  process prior. We evaluate LEAP on a number of datasets including video and
  motion capture data. Experiments demonstrate that temporally causal latent
  processes are reliably identified from observed variables under different
  dependency structure and our approach considerably outperforms those existing
  methods without leveraging history or nonstationarity information. This is one
  of the first works that successfully recover time-delayed latent processes
  from nonlinear mixtures without using sparsity or minimality assumptions. "
